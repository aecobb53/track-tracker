## format_meet_dates.py
This is just to look at the annual meet schedule and link the meet files so we can track which day the meet happened on. This is consumed in meet_results_formatter.py.

## meet_results_formatter.py
This is the big guy. It looks through the results directories and grabs each meets data. Then parses every entry. Then saves all athlete data in the HuGE JSON FILE.

## data_curator.py
Takes the formatted HUGE JSON FILE and extracts athlete and team specific results. Then creates two new files with that data.

## populate_db.py
Takes the results files and adds them to the local DB.

## meets_formatter.py
I actually dont remember what this is for

## data_loader_formatter.py
This is a copy of meet_results_formatter.py to make uploading meets long term



## new_big_json_formatter.py
## new_populate_db.py
## populate_workouts.py
## hurdle_takeoff_distance_maintainer.py


# Etc

## year_overview/
```
year_overview/
    YYYY-YYYY_meets.txt
    meet_dates.json
```
    - The meets.txt file just has the meets for that year so we can track what day the meet occurred on
    - The meet_dates.json file is the combination of the other files as generated by the `format_meet_dates.py` script

## YYYY-YYYY_results/
```
YYYY-YYYY_results/
    <Meet Name>.txt
```
    - Each file is a different meet with results

## tmp/
I need a dumping ground for the generated files
